# 1. Mission Statement
# - "Bringing collaboration to fitness"

# Problem: In today's world, it has become increasingly simple to stay entertained at home with streaming platforms and online connections.  It is difficult to get the motivation to work out alone when there are so many ways to feel connected at home. It is also difficult to track a group of people's progress remotely. For example, coaches for college athletics teams lose the ability to train with athletes when they travel home for breaks. This can lead to people skipping workouts, or even overtraining and leaving them at risk of injuries. In the case of individuals working out, a lack of motivation can lead to worse or no workouts. Having a community can help motivation, and often, it is difficult to find a community that shares your interests.
